Hello! My name is Chong Kang Rui, and I work as a game developer with a focus on programming. 
I always enjoy creating video games and do it with a lot of passion. Furthermore, I find the operation of gaming engines to be very interesting, and it is always entertaining to learn how game engines work to make a video game. My area of expertise is listed on my home page, and my previous work is included in my portfolio.
