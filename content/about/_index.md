Hello! My name is Chong Kang Rui, and I work as a game developer with a focus on programming. 
I always enjoy creating video games and do it with a lot of passion. Furthermore, I find the operation of gaming engines to be very interesting, and learning how game engines work to create a video game is always entertaining. My expertise is highlighted on my home page, and my works are showcased in my portfolio. Please feel free to look around.
